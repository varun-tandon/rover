# ISSUE-009: Silent error swallowing in loadIssueStore

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Hidden Control Flow
**Detected by**: obviousness-auditor
**File**: `src/storage/issues.ts:49-69`

## Description

The loadIssueStore function catches all errors and returns an empty store, hiding potential issues like permission errors, corrupted JSON, or filesystem problems. This makes it impossible to distinguish between 'no issues file exists' and 'issues file exists but is corrupted/unreadable'.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
try {
  const content = await readFile(issuesPath, 'utf-8');
  const store = JSON.parse(content) as IssueStore;
  // ...
} catch {
  return createEmptyStore(); // Hides all error types
}
```

## Recommendation

Check for file existence explicitly with existsSync first (already done), then only catch JSON parsing errors specifically. Let filesystem permission errors and other unexpected errors propagate. Consider logging when returning empty store due to corruption.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "Genuine issue. The catch block at line 66 silently swallows ALL errors including filesystem permission issues, corrupted JSON, and unexpected errors. Since existsSync is already used at line 52, the code should distinguish between 'file doesn't exist' and 'file exists but unreadable/corrupted'. The recommendation to catch only JSON parsing errors specifically is appropriate - permission errors and unexpected filesystem issues should propagate to help developers debug real problems. Severity 'medium' is reasonable as silent failures can hide operational issues."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The catch block at line 66 silently swallows all errors including filesystem permission errors, corrupted JSON, and other unexpected failures. The code already checks for file existence at line 52, so the try-catch should only handle JSON parsing errors specifically. Distinguishing between 'file doesn't exist' vs 'file is corrupted' is important for debugging. The recommendation to catch JSON.parse errors specifically and let other errors propagate is sound and would improve maintainability without significant cost."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. Lines 56-68 show a try-catch that catches all errors indiscriminately, including filesystem permission errors, corrupted JSON, and other unexpected failures. The recommendation is sound: since existsSync already handles the 'file doesn't exist' case on line 52, the catch block should be more specific (e.g., catching only SyntaxError for JSON.parse failures) or at minimum log the error. This would help developers diagnose real problems like corrupted stores or permission issues instead of silently returning empty data. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a diagnostics/observability issue."
