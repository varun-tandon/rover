# ISSUE-043: AgentResult interface missing documentation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/agents/batch-runner.ts:18-24`

## Description

The exported interface `AgentResult` lacks documentation explaining what it represents and when it's used.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
export interface AgentResult {
  agentId: string;
  agentName: string;
  scanResult: ScannerResult;
  voterResults: VoterResult[];
  arbitratorResult: ArbitratorResult;
}
```

## Recommendation

Add TSDoc explaining that this represents the complete result from running a single agent through the scan-vote-arbitrate pipeline.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. AgentResult is a public exported interface used as a return type in public functions (runSingleAgent returns it, onAgentComplete callback receives it). While BatchProgress (line 9) has no documentation either, AgentResult represents a core data structure in the agent pipeline. The interface aggregates results from multiple phases (scan, vote, arbitrate) and would benefit from TSDoc explaining its purpose. The recommendation is appropriate and the medium severity is reasonable - this is a public API that consumers need to understand."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The AgentResult interface is exported and used as a public API type (returned by runAgentsBatched and accepted by onAgentComplete callback). It lacks documentation while the similar BatchProgress interface (lines 9-16) and BatchRunResult interface (lines 26-34) also lack documentation. However, this is a core data structure representing the complete pipeline result (scan-vote-arbitrate) and would benefit from TSDoc explaining its purpose. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a public API interface, and adding documentation would improve code maintainability and developer experience."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. AgentResult is an exported interface used as return type in public APIs (runAgentsBatched, runSingleAgent). While BatchProgress and BatchRunResult interfaces nearby also lack documentation, this interface represents a core data structure returned from the scan-vote-arbitrate pipeline. The recommendation to add TSDoc is appropriate and would improve API usability. The severity of medium is reasonable given this is a public API interface."
