# ISSUE-045: Throttle utility function lacks documentation

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Missing Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/components/App.tsx:23-46`

## Description

The `throttle` function in App.tsx is a reusable utility but has no documentation. While it's not exported from the module, it's a non-trivial implementation that would benefit from inline documentation for maintainability.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
function throttle<T extends (...args: Parameters<T>) => void>(
  fn: T,
  delay: number
): T
```

## Recommendation

Add a JSDoc comment explaining the throttling mechanism, parameters, and behavior (especially the trailing call behavior).

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The throttle function (lines 23-46) is a non-trivial utility with complex behavior including trailing call scheduling. While there's a brief comment on line 23, it lacks proper JSDoc documentation explaining parameters, return value, and the sophisticated trailing call mechanism (lines 38-44). This function is used twice in the component (lines 69-71, 85-93), making it important for maintainability. Adding JSDoc would significantly help future developers understand the throttling behavior. Severity 'low' is appropriate since the code works and has a minimal comment, but documentation would improve code quality."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The throttle function is a non-trivial implementation with trailing call behavior (lines 38-43) that isn't immediately obvious. While it has a brief comment on line 23, proper JSDoc documentation explaining the parameters, return value, and the specific trailing call mechanism would significantly improve maintainability. This is a legitimate low-severity issue that would benefit the codebase without requiring significant effort to fix."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The throttle function (lines 23-46) is a non-trivial implementation with subtle behavior including trailing call logic (the setTimeout that ensures the function is called after the delay expires). While there's a minimal comment on line 23, it doesn't explain the parameters, return value, or the important trailing call behavior. JSDoc documentation would significantly improve maintainability, especially since the function is reused multiple times in the file (lines 70, 86). The severity rating of 'low' is appropriate since it's internal to the file and not a critical defect."
