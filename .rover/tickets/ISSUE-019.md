# ISSUE-019: Magic number 200 without explanation in throttle function

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Why
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/components/App.tsx:68-71`

## Description

The throttle function uses a magic number '200' for the delay parameter in a comment 'update at most every 200ms', but there's no explanation of WHY 200ms was chosen. This is a performance tuning decision that should be documented - is it based on human perception limits, React rendering constraints, or testing?

## Problematic Code

```typescript
// Throttled message setter (update at most every 200ms)
const throttledSetScanMessage = useRef(
  throttle((msg: string) => setScanMessage(msg), 200)
).current;
```

## Recommendation

Add a comment explaining why 200ms was chosen: '// 200ms chosen to balance UI responsiveness with React render performance - below 16ms (60fps) causes excessive re-renders, above 500ms feels laggy'

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The code at lines 68-71 uses 200ms as a magic number with only a 'what' comment ('update at most every 200ms') but no explanation of 'why' 200ms was chosen. This is a performance-tuning decision that would benefit from documentation explaining the rationale. The recommendation is reasonable and would improve code maintainability. Notably, there's another throttle at line 92 using 300ms, suggesting these values were deliberately chosen and deserve explanation."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. Line 68-71 shows a throttle with 200ms delay and a comment stating 'update at most every 200ms' which describes WHAT happens, not WHY 200ms was chosen. The magic number lacks justification - this is a performance tuning decision that would benefit from explaining the rationale. The recommendation is appropriate and would improve code maintainability. Medium severity is correct as this is important for maintainability but not a functional bug."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. Lines 68-71 show a throttle with 200ms and a comment explaining WHAT it does but not WHY 200ms was chosen. This is a performance tuning decision that would benefit from explaining the rationale - especially since line 92 uses a different value (300ms) for similar throttling, suggesting these values were deliberately chosen. The recommendation is reasonable and would improve code maintainability."
