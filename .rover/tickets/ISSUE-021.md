# ISSUE-021: Magic number 150 in BatchApp throttle without explanation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Why
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/components/BatchApp.tsx:49-52`

## Description

The BatchApp uses 150ms as the throttle delay, which is different from App.tsx (200ms and 300ms). There's no explanation of WHY different values are used in different components or what criteria determined 150ms.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
// Throttled progress update
const throttledSetProgress = useRef(
  throttle((progress: BatchProgress) => setCurrentProgress(progress), 150)
).current;
```

## Recommendation

Add a comment explaining the timing choice: '// 150ms for batch updates - faster than single agent (200ms) because batch progress changes less frequently per agent'

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. BatchApp.tsx uses 150ms throttle, while App.tsx uses 200ms for scan messages and 300ms for voter updates. Different throttle values across components without explanation creates maintenance confusion. The recommendation is valuable - explaining that batch updates use 150ms because progress changes less frequently per agent would clarify the intentional design choice and help future maintainers understand the timing strategy."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "Genuine issue. BatchApp uses 150ms throttle while App.tsx uses 200ms and 300ms for different purposes. The lack of explanation for why 150ms was chosen creates maintenance confusion. The recommended comment would add valuable context about the rationale for different timing values across components."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "Genuine issue. BatchApp.tsx uses 150ms throttle while App.tsx uses 200ms and 300ms for different purposes. The different values are intentional but lack explanation of why these specific timings were chosen, making maintenance harder. The recommendation provides useful context about the timing differences and would improve code maintainability."
