# ISSUE-042: BatchProgress interface missing documentation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/agents/batch-runner.ts:9-16`

## Description

The exported interface `BatchProgress` has no documentation explaining when it's used or what each field represents in the context of batch processing.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
export interface BatchProgress {
  phase: 'scanning' | 'voting' | 'arbitrating';
  agentId: string;
  agentName: string;
  completedCount: number;
  totalAgents: number;
  message: string;
}
```

## Recommendation

Add TSDoc explaining that this interface represents progress updates during batch agent execution, with descriptions for each field.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. BatchProgress is a public exported interface used in a callback (line 159) to communicate progress during batch agent execution. It lacks documentation explaining its purpose and the meaning of each field. The interface has a specific domain context (batch processing with phases like scanning, voting, arbitrating) that is not self-evident. Adding TSDoc would improve API usability for consumers of this module. The severity of medium is appropriate - this is a public API documentation gap, not critical but worth fixing for code quality."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The BatchProgress interface is exported and used as a public API (line 159 shows it's used in the onProgress callback parameter). The interface represents progress updates during batch agent execution but has no documentation explaining its purpose or field meanings. The phase field is particularly cryptic - users wouldn't know what 'scanning', 'voting', or 'arbitrating' mean without reading implementation details. Adding TSDoc would significantly improve API usability. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for missing documentation on a public API."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The BatchProgress interface is exported and used as a callback parameter in the public API (runAgentsBatched function at line 159). The interface has no documentation explaining its purpose or field meanings. Given that this is a public API with multiple fields (phase, agentId, agentName, completedCount, totalAgents, message), adding TSDoc would significantly improve developer experience and API usability. The severity (medium) is appropriate for missing documentation on a public interface. This is a genuine issue that would benefit the codebase."
