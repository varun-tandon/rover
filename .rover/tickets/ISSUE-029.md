# ISSUE-029: Vague variable name: parsed

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Vague Variable
**Detected by**: naming-renovator
**File**: `src/agents/scanner.ts:90-103`

## Description

The variable 'parsed' is used across multiple contexts (lines 90, 103) to represent different types of parsed data. In one case it's a vote response, in another it's scanner result issues. This generic name doesn't indicate what type of data has been parsed or what it represents, making the code harder to understand without examining surrounding context.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
const parsed = JSON.parse(jsonMatch[0]) as { approve?: boolean; reasoning?: string };
const parsed = JSON.parse(jsonMatch[0]) as { issues?: unknown[] };
```

## Recommendation

Rename to more specific names based on context: 'parsedVoteResponse' in voter.ts:90 and 'parsedScannerOutput' in scanner.ts:103

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The variable 'parsed' appears in two different files (voter.ts:90 and scanner.ts:103) representing different data structures: a vote response object and scanner result issues. While the name is technically correct (both are parsed JSON), it's generic and context-dependent. The recommendations 'parsedVoteResponse' and 'parsedScannerOutput' would improve readability by making the data type immediately clear without examining surrounding code. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a readability issue."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The variable 'parsed' is used in two different files (voter.ts:90 and scanner.ts:103) to represent different types of parsed data - one for vote responses and one for scanner output. While the variable is locally scoped and technically not ambiguous within each function, using more descriptive names like 'parsedVoteResponse' and 'parsedScannerOutput' would improve code readability and self-documentation. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate as this affects maintainability but doesn't break functionality. The recommendation is practical and would make the code easier to understand at a glance."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. Both files use 'parsed' to store JSON.parse results of different data structures: voter.ts:90 parses a vote response with approve/reasoning fields, while scanner.ts:103 parses scanner output with an issues array. The generic name 'parsed' provides no information about what was parsed or what the data represents. Renaming to 'parsedVoteResponse' and 'parsedScannerOutput' would meaningfully improve code clarity without negative side effects. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a readability issue that affects multiple files."
