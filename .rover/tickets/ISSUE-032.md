# ISSUE-032: Vague single-letter variable: v

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Vague Variable
**Detected by**: naming-renovator
**File**: `src/components/App.tsx:87-91`

## Description

The variable 'v' is used in multiple contexts across the codebase (Results.tsx:26, App.tsx:87-91, tickets.ts:125-129, arbitrator.ts:25, 104) to represent different types: Vote, VoterStatus, and other objects. In many cases, these uses span multiple lines of logic, making the single letter too vague. For example, in App.tsx lines 87-91, 'v' represents a VoterStatus object being mapped over 5 lines of code.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
setVoterStatuses(prev => prev.map(v => ({
  ...v,
  status: 'voting' as const,
  votesCompleted: voterProgressRef.current.get(v.id) ?? v.votesCompleted
})));
```

## Recommendation

Rename based on context: 'vote' when iterating over Vote objects, 'voterStatus' when iterating over VoterStatus objects

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The variable 'v' is used in three different map functions (lines 87, 170, 181) to represent VoterStatus objects, spanning 4-5 lines of logic each. The single-letter name is vague and hurts readability, especially since VoterStatus has multiple properties being accessed (id, status, votesCompleted, totalVotes). Renaming to 'voterStatus' or 'voter' would significantly improve code clarity. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate - it's not critical but does impact maintainability. The recommendation is sensible and would make the code more self-documenting."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "Genuine issue. The variable 'v' is used in App.tsx lines 87-91 and 170 to represent VoterStatus objects in map operations spanning multiple lines. In Results.tsx line 26 and tickets.ts lines 120, 126-127, 'v' represents Vote objects. The single-letter name obscures the type being operated on, especially in multi-line transformations. Renaming to 'voterStatus' or 'vote' based on context would significantly improve readability without any downside."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "Genuine issue. The variable 'v' represents VoterStatus objects in a multi-line map operation (lines 87-91, 170, 181-185). The context shows 'v' is used repeatedly throughout the file in different contexts - making it ambiguous. Using 'voterStatus' would significantly improve readability, especially in the 5-line mapping operation where multiple properties are accessed (v.id, v.votesCompleted). The same pattern appears in Results.tsx:26 and arbitrator.ts:25,104 for Vote objects. This is a legitimate medium-severity naming issue that would benefit the codebase if fixed."
