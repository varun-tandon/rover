# ISSUE-027: Obvious getter function comments in storage/tickets.ts

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Syntax Translation
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/storage/tickets.ts:9-28`

## Description

Similar to issues.ts, the tickets.ts file has multiple obvious 'Get' function comments that restate what the function name already says: 'Get the path to the tickets directory', 'Ensure the tickets directory exists', 'Generate the next ticket number'.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Get the path to the tickets directory
 */
export function getTicketsDir(targetPath: string): string {
  return join(getRoverDir(targetPath), TICKETS_DIR);
}

/**
 * Ensure the tickets directory exists
 */
export async function ensureTicketsDir(targetPath: string): Promise<void> {
```

## Recommendation

Remove these obvious comments. If context is needed, explain the ISSUE-NNN naming convention choice or why tickets are in a separate directory from issues.json.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. Comments on lines 9-10, 16-17, and 26-27 are textbook examples of 'syntax translation' - they merely restate what the function names already clearly communicate. The function names 'getTicketsDir', 'ensureTicketsDir', and 'getNextTicketNumber' are self-documenting. These comments add no value and could be removed or replaced with 'why' explanations (e.g., why tickets use ISSUE-NNN format, why they're separate from issues.json). The severity 'low' is appropriate since this is a documentation quality issue, not a functional problem."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The comments at lines 9-11, 16-18, and 26-28 are textbook examples of 'syntax translation' - they simply restate what the function names already clearly communicate. The function names 'getTicketsDir', 'ensureTicketsDir', and 'getNextTicketNumber' are self-documenting. These comments add no value about WHY these functions exist or WHY the architectural decisions were made (e.g., why tickets are in a separate directory with ISSUE-NNN naming). Removing them would improve code clarity by reducing noise. The severity 'low' is appropriate since this is a documentation issue, not a functional problem."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. Lines 9-11, 16-18, and 26-28 contain comments that merely restate what the function names already clearly communicate. These are textbook examples of 'what' comments rather than 'why' comments. The function names getTicketsDir, ensureTicketsDir, and getNextTicketNumber are self-documenting. The recommendation to remove these or replace with meaningful context (like explaining the ISSUE-NNN convention or architectural decisions) would improve code quality without any downside."
