# ISSUE-005: storage/issues.ts: getExistingIssuesSummaryText is a thin wrapper over getExistingIssueSummaries

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Pass-Through Class
**Detected by**: layer-petrifier
**File**: `src/storage/issues.ts:124-138`

## Description

The function `getExistingIssuesSummaryText` exists solely to format the output of `getExistingIssueSummaries` into a string. However, this function is never called - instead, `summarizeExistingIssues` is used directly by scanner.ts. This creates an unused middleman layer that was likely superseded by the LLM-based summarization approach but never removed.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
export async function getExistingIssuesSummaryText(
  targetPath: string
): Promise<string> {
  const summaries = await getExistingIssueSummaries(targetPath);

  if (summaries.length === 0) {
    return 'No existing issues detected yet.';
  }

  const lines = summaries.map(s =>
    `- [${s.category}] ${s.title} (${s.filePath})`
  );

  return `Previously detected issues (${summaries.length} total):\n${lines.join('\n')}`;
}
```

## Recommendation

Remove the unused `getExistingIssuesSummaryText` function entirely since `summarizeExistingIssues` now serves this purpose with LLM-based condensed summaries. The simple formatting logic it provides is obsolete.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The function `getExistingIssuesSummaryText` is exported but never imported or used anywhere in the codebase. It was superseded by `summarizeExistingIssues` which provides LLM-based summarization for larger issue sets (>5 issues) and has better formatting with line ranges. The simple formatting logic in `getExistingIssuesSummaryText` is indeed obsolete and removing it would clean up dead code. The severity is appropriately marked as low since it doesn't affect functionality, just code cleanliness."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "Genuine dead code. The function getExistingIssuesSummaryText (lines 124-138) is never called in the codebase, while summarizeExistingIssues serves the same purpose with LLM-based summarization and is actively used by scanner.ts. The simple formatting logic in getExistingIssuesSummaryText is redundant - summarizeExistingIssues even implements the same fallback formatting for small issue counts (lines 197-202). Removing this unused function would eliminate maintenance burden and reduce confusion about which function to use."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "This is a genuine unused function. The codebase only references getExistingIssuesSummaryText in its definition at line 124 of issues.ts. The actual caller (scanner.ts:19) uses summarizeExistingIssues instead, which provides more sophisticated LLM-based summarization for larger issue sets. The function getExistingIssuesSummaryText (lines 124-138) is dead code that can be safely removed. The severity 'low' is appropriate since it's unused code that doesn't affect functionality, but removing it would improve code maintainability."
