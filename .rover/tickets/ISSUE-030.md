# ISSUE-030: Vague variable name: lines

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Vague Variable
**Detected by**: naming-renovator
**File**: `src/storage/issues.ts:91-133`

## Description

The variable 'lines' appears multiple times (issues.ts:91, 133, tickets.ts:74, arbitrator.ts:91) as a generic array accumulator. While 'lines' is somewhat descriptive, it's vague about what the lines represent. In issues.ts it's summary lines, in tickets.ts it's markdown content lines, and in arbitrator.ts it's summary report lines. The name doesn't distinguish between these different purposes.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
const lines: string[] = [];
```

## Recommendation

Rename based on context: 'summaryLines' in issues.ts:91 and 133, 'markdownLines' in tickets.ts:74, 'reportLines' in arbitrator.ts:91

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "Genuine issue. The variable 'lines' is used in three different contexts with different semantic meanings: summary lines (issues.ts:133, 198, 238), markdown content lines (tickets.ts:74), and report summary lines (arbitrator.ts:91). The recommendations ('summaryLines', 'markdownLines', 'reportLines') are appropriate and would improve readability without being overly verbose. The severity of 'low' is accurate as this doesn't break functionality but does reduce code clarity."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "Genuine issue. The variable 'lines' is used in three different contexts with different semantic meanings: formatting markdown ticket content (tickets.ts:74), formatting summary text (issues.ts:133, 198, 238), and formatting arbitration reports (arbitrator.ts:91). The recommended names ('markdownLines', 'summaryLines', 'reportLines') accurately reflect the purpose in each context and would improve code clarity. This is a legitimate readability improvement, not a false positive."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "Genuine issue. The variable 'lines' appears in all three files as a generic accumulator for different purposes: formatting issue summaries (issues.ts:133, 198, 238), generating markdown ticket content (tickets.ts:74), and creating arbitration reports (arbitrator.ts:91). The recommendations 'summaryLines', 'markdownLines', and 'reportLines' would improve code clarity by making the purpose explicit in each context. This is a legitimate readability improvement with minimal risk."
