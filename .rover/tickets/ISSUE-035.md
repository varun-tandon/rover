# ISSUE-035: runScanner missing parameter documentation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/agents/scanner.ts:7-10`

## Description

The exported function `runScanner` has a brief one-line comment but lacks detailed TSDoc documentation. It's missing @param tags for the options parameter, @returns description, and @throws documentation for potential errors. Users need to understand what each option does and what errors might be thrown.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Run the scanner agent to detect issues in the codebase
 */
export async function runScanner(options: ScannerOptions): Promise<ScannerResult>
```

## Recommendation

Add complete TSDoc with @param, @returns, and @throws tags. Include descriptions of what the function does, when to use it, and what each parameter means.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The `runScanner` function is an exported public API with a complex interface (ScannerOptions with 4 properties including an optional callback), returns a complex result type, and throws errors (line 15: 'Unknown agent' error, line 125: rethrows caught errors). The current one-line comment is insufficient for API consumers who need to understand the options parameter structure, return value details, and potential error scenarios. Adding @param, @returns, and @throws documentation would significantly improve the developer experience."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The runScanner function is a public API that is exported and has complex behavior (throws errors, has multiple options, performs async operations). While the ScannerOptions interface has documentation on the type level, the function itself lacks proper TSDoc. Given the function's complexity (126 lines, multiple error paths, async operations), documenting @param, @returns, @throws would significantly improve API usability. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate as the lack of documentation could lead to improper usage but doesn't break functionality."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The runScanner function is an exported public API that takes a complex options parameter (ScannerOptions with 4 properties including optional callback) and can throw errors (line 15, 125). The current documentation is minimal (one-line comment) and lacks @param, @returns, and @throws tags. Adding complete TSDoc would help API consumers understand what each option does, what to expect as return value, and what errors might be thrown. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a public API function."
