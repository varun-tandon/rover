# ISSUE-018: Obvious function description comment - 'Count approvals for an issue'

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Syntax Translation
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/agents/arbitrator.ts:21-23`

## Description

The comment 'Count approvals for an issue' restates exactly what the function name 'countApprovals' already says. This is a textbook example of a useless 'what' comment.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Count approvals for an issue
 */
function countApprovals(votes: Vote[]): number {
```

## Recommendation

Remove this comment entirely.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The comment 'Count approvals for an issue' at lines 21-23 merely restates what the function name 'countApprovals' already clearly communicates. The function's implementation (line 25) is also self-explanatory. This is a textbook redundant 'what' comment that adds no value. Removing it would improve code quality by eliminating noise. The severity (low) is appropriate as this is a minor code quality issue, not a functional problem."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The comment 'Count approvals for an issue' on line 21-23 is redundant - it merely translates the function name 'countApprovals' into plain English without adding any context about why this counting is done or any non-obvious behavior. The function implementation (filtering votes where approve=true) is self-explanatory. Comparing this to other comments in the file like the one on lines 28-36 which explains the arbitrator's purpose and workflow, this comment adds no value. Removing it would improve code quality by reducing noise."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The comment 'Count approvals for an issue' at lines 21-23 merely restates what the function name 'countApprovals' already conveys. The function implementation (filtering votes where approve is true and returning length) is self-evident. This is a clear example of a redundant 'what' comment that adds no value. Removing it would improve code quality by eliminating noise. The severity rating of 'low' is appropriate as this doesn't affect functionality, only code cleanliness."
