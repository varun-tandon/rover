# ISSUE-038: runArbitrator has incomplete documentation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Incomplete Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/agents/arbitrator.ts:28-37`

## Description

While `runArbitrator` has a multi-line comment describing what it does, it lacks proper TSDoc tags. Missing @param, @returns, and @throws documentation. The comment describes the algorithm but doesn't use TSDoc format that tooling can parse.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Run the arbitrator to filter issues and create tickets
 *
 * The arbitrator:
 * 1. Collects all votes for each candidate issue
 * 2. Filters to only issues with majority approval (default: 2/3 votes)
 * 3. Creates ticket files for approved issues
 * 4. Updates the issue store
 */
export async function runArbitrator(options: ArbitratorOptions): Promise<ArbitratorResult>
```

## Recommendation

Convert the existing comment to proper TSDoc format with @param tags for each option field, @returns describing the result structure, and examples of minimum vote thresholds.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The runArbitrator function is a core public API with an existing descriptive comment, but it lacks proper TSDoc format with @param, @returns, and @throws tags. The ArbitratorOptions interface has well-documented fields, and ArbitratorResult is documented, but the function itself doesn't follow TSDoc conventions that enable IDE tooling and automated documentation generation. Converting to proper TSDoc would improve API discoverability and consistency with the rest of the codebase (e.g., the types.ts file shows proper TSDoc format). Severity of medium is appropriate as this affects a public API but doesn't impact functionality."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function `runArbitrator` is a public API export and has a descriptive comment but lacks proper TSDoc format with @param, @returns, and @throws tags. This is inconsistent with other functions in the file (like `groupVotesByIssue` and `countApprovals`) that use TSDoc format. Converting to TSDoc would improve IDE tooling support, type hints, and documentation generation. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a public API function."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "Genuine issue. The function is a public API export with a multi-line comment, but lacks proper TSDoc format (@param, @returns, @throws). The ArbitratorOptions interface has documented fields in types.ts, but consumers reading the function signature would benefit from inline TSDoc. Other helper functions in the same file use minimal docs since they're internal. Converting to TSDoc would improve IDE intellisense and tool parsing. Severity 'medium' is appropriate for a public API function."
