# ISSUE-037: runVotersInParallel missing comprehensive documentation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/agents/voter.ts:130-139`

## Description

The exported function `runVotersInParallel` has only a brief one-line comment. It lacks @param descriptions for all its parameters, @returns documentation, and examples of usage. Given it accepts 5 parameters with a default value, users need clear guidance on how to use it.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Run multiple voters in parallel
 */
export async function runVotersInParallel(
  targetPath: string,
  agentId: string,
  issues: CandidateIssue[],
  voterCount: number = 3,
  onProgress?: (voterId: string, issueId: string, completed: boolean) => void
): Promise<VoterResult[]>
```

## Recommendation

Add detailed TSDoc with @param tags for all parameters (especially the callback), @returns description, and an @example showing typical usage.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The function `runVotersInParallel` is an exported public API with 5 parameters including a callback and a default value, but only has a one-line comment. The function's purpose isn't immediately clear from its brief documentation - users would benefit from knowing what each parameter does (especially `targetPath`, `agentId`, and the `onProgress` callback signature), what it returns (array of VoterResult objects), and when/why to use it. Adding comprehensive TSDoc with @param, @returns, and @example would significantly improve developer experience. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a public API function."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "This is a legitimate issue. The function is exported as a public API with 5 parameters including a default value and an optional callback, but has only a brief one-line comment. The similar function 'runVoter' (lines 6-128) shows that proper documentation is feasible. Adding @param, @returns, and @example tags would significantly improve usability, especially for the onProgress callback whose signature (voterId, issueId, completed) is not obvious from the type annotation alone. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a public API function."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The function `runVotersInParallel` is an exported public API with 5 parameters (including a default value and an optional callback) but has minimal documentation. The function signature is complex enough that users would benefit from: (1) detailed @param descriptions explaining what each parameter does, especially the `onProgress` callback signature with 3 parameters, (2) @returns documentation explaining the structure of VoterResult[], and (3) an @example showing typical usage. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate - this won't break code but does impact developer experience and API usability."
