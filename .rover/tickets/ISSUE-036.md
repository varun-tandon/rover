# ISSUE-036: runVoter missing parameter documentation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/agents/voter.ts:6-9`

## Description

The exported function `runVoter` has a brief comment but lacks detailed TSDoc. Missing @param descriptions, @returns documentation, and @throws for error cases. This is a public API function that needs comprehensive documentation.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Run a voter agent to validate candidate issues
 */
export async function runVoter(options: VoterOptions): Promise<VoterResult>
```

## Recommendation

Add complete TSDoc documentation with @param, @returns, and @throws tags explaining what the function does, its parameters, return value, and potential errors.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The runVoter function is a public API export with a complex options object and return type. While it has a brief comment, it lacks detailed TSDoc with @param, @returns, and @throws tags. Given that VoterOptions has 5 properties (voterId, targetPath, agentId, issues, onProgress) and the function throws errors (line 14), comprehensive documentation would significantly improve API usability. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a public API function."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The runVoter function is an exported public API with a brief one-line comment but lacks proper TSDoc documentation. The function has complex behavior (validates candidate issues, handles errors, makes API calls, processes votes), accepts a multi-property options object, returns a structured result, and throws errors. The VoterOptions type has 5 properties that should be documented, and the VoterResult has 4 properties. Adding @param, @returns, and @throws documentation would significantly improve API usability and developer experience. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a public API function."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The function is a public API export that orchestrates a complex voting process, handles errors, parses JSON responses, and throws errors. The current documentation is minimal (just one line) while the function has multiple parameters via VoterOptions, returns structured data, and can throw errors. Adding @param, @returns, and @throws documentation would significantly improve API usability and developer experience, especially given the complexity of the function's behavior."
