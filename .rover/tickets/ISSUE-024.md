# ISSUE-024: Obvious 'Get' function comments in storage/issues.ts

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Syntax Translation
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/storage/issues.ts:11-23`

## Description

Multiple simple getter functions have obvious comments that just restate the function name: 'Get the path to the .rover directory', 'Get the path to the issues.json file', 'Get summaries of existing issues'. These are pure syntax translation.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Get the path to the .rover directory for a target path
 */
export function getRoverDir(targetPath: string): string {
  return join(targetPath, ROVER_DIR);
}

/**
 * Get the path to the issues.json file
 */
export function getIssuesPath(targetPath: string): string {
```

## Recommendation

Remove these comments. The function names are self-documenting. If any context is needed, explain WHY the .rover directory convention was chosen.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. Lines 11-13 (getRoverDir), 18-20 (getIssuesPath), and 105-107 (getExistingIssueSummaries) all have comments that merely restate what the function name already communicates. The function names are clear and self-documenting. These comments provide no additional 'why' context - they don't explain why .rover was chosen as the directory name or why this storage structure exists. The severity is appropriately low, and removing these comments would reduce noise without losing any valuable information."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. Lines 11-23 contain comments that merely restate what the function names already convey ('Get the path to the .rover directory' for getRoverDir, 'Get the path to the issues.json file' for getIssuesPath). These are textbook examples of syntax translation comments that add no value. The function names are already self-documenting. The recommendation to remove these comments is appropriate, and the low severity is correctly assessed since this is a minor documentation quality issue that doesn't affect functionality."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. Lines 11-23 contain obvious comments that simply restate what the function names already communicate clearly. 'Get the path to the .rover directory' for getRoverDir() and 'Get the path to the issues.json file' for getIssuesPath() are pure syntax translations that add no value. The function names, parameter names, and return types already make the 'what' clear. The recommendation to remove these comments or replace them with 'why' context (e.g., why the .rover convention was chosen) is sound and would improve code quality without causing harm."
