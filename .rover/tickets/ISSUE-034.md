# ISSUE-034: Generic function name: worker

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Vague Function
**Detected by**: naming-renovator
**File**: `src/agents/batch-runner.ts:175-211`

## Description

The function 'worker' at line 175 in batch-runner.ts is a vague name that doesn't convey what work it performs. This function processes agents from a queue and executes them, but 'worker' is a generic pattern name that doesn't describe the domain-specific purpose.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
async function worker(): Promise<void> {
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const agentId = queue.shift();
    ...
  }
}
```

## Recommendation

Rename to 'processAgentFromQueue', 'agentWorker', or 'executeNextAgent' to be more specific

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function 'worker' at line 175 is indeed a vague name that doesn't convey its domain-specific purpose. While 'worker' is a common pattern name in concurrent programming, the function specifically processes agents from a queue through the scan-vote-arbitrate pipeline. Renaming to 'processAgentFromQueue' or 'agentWorker' would make the code more self-documenting and improve readability. This is a legitimate low-severity naming issue that would benefit the codebase if fixed, especially since this is a specific agent processing context rather than a generic worker pool."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "This is a genuine issue. The function 'worker' at line 175 implements a work-queue pattern but the generic name doesn't convey its domain-specific purpose of processing agents. The function pulls agent IDs from a queue and runs them through the scan-vote-arbitrate pipeline. A more descriptive name like 'processAgentFromQueue' or 'agentWorker' would better communicate what work is being performed, improving code readability for maintainers unfamiliar with this module. The severity is appropriately low since the code is functional, but the rename would provide modest clarity improvements."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function 'worker' at line 175 is a generic implementation pattern name that doesn't convey its domain-specific purpose. In this context, it processes agents from a queue by running them through a scanning/voting/arbitration pipeline. Renaming to 'processAgentFromQueue' or 'agentWorker' would make the code more self-documenting and improve readability. The severity of 'low' is appropriate since the function is locally scoped with a clear comment above it, but the name could still be more descriptive. This is a legitimate naming issue that would benefit the codebase if addressed."
