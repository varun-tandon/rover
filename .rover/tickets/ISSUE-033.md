# ISSUE-033: Generic function name: run

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Vague Function
**Detected by**: naming-renovator
**File**: `src/components/BatchApp.tsx:55-119`

## Description

The function 'run' at line 55 in BatchApp.tsx is too generic. It doesn't indicate what it runs or what the purpose is. This is an async function that orchestrates the entire batch scanning workflow, but the name 'run' provides no context about this important responsibility.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
async function run() {
  // Validation
  if (!existsSync(resolvedPath)) { ... }
}
```

## Recommendation

Rename to 'runBatchScan', 'executeBatchWorkflow', or 'initializeBatchScan' to indicate its purpose

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The function 'run' at line 55 is indeed too generic. It's a complex async function inside a useEffect that orchestrates validation, dry-run logic, batch agent execution, progress tracking, and error handling. The name 'run' provides no context about its purpose. In React components, especially within useEffect hooks, descriptive function names like 'runBatchScan', 'executeBatchWorkflow', or 'initializeBatchScan' would significantly improve readability and maintainability. This is a legitimate issue with appropriate severity."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function 'run' at line 55 is defined inside a useEffect hook and orchestrates validation, agent initialization, batch execution, and error handling - a complex workflow. The name 'run' is too generic for such an important function. Given this is a React component with multiple nested functions, a more descriptive name like 'runBatchScan' or 'executeBatchWorkflow' would significantly improve code readability. The severity is appropriate as medium - it's not critical but would meaningfully improve maintainability."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function 'run' at line 55 is indeed too generic for its purpose. It orchestrates the entire batch scanning workflow including validation, initialization, agent execution, progress tracking, and error handling - approximately 65 lines of complex logic. The function is defined within a useEffect hook but the name 'run' provides no context about what it does. Renaming to 'runBatchScan' or 'executeBatchWorkflow' would significantly improve code readability, especially for developers navigating this component. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate given this is a local function within a component, not a public API."
