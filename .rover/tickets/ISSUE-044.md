# ISSUE-044: BatchRunResult interface missing documentation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/agents/batch-runner.ts:26-34`

## Description

The exported interface `BatchRunResult` lacks documentation explaining the aggregated results from batch execution.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
export interface BatchRunResult {
  agentResults: AgentResult[];
  totalCandidateIssues: number;
  totalApprovedIssues: number;
  totalRejectedIssues: number;
  totalTickets: number;
  totalDurationMs: number;
  totalCostUsd: number;
}
```

## Recommendation

Add TSDoc explaining this is the aggregated result from running multiple agents in batch mode, with descriptions of summary fields.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. BatchRunResult is a public exported interface (line 26-34) that lacks TSDoc documentation. The interface represents aggregated results from batch execution with 7 fields tracking various metrics. Given that BatchProgress (lines 9-16) and AgentResult (lines 18-24) also lack documentation, and this is part of a public API being exported, adding TSDoc would improve code maintainability and developer experience. The severity 'medium' is appropriate - it's not critical but meaningful for API consumers. The recommendation is reasonable and actionable."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The BatchRunResult interface is indeed exported and lacks documentation. Given that it's a public API return type with multiple aggregated fields, TSDoc would genuinely improve code maintainability and developer experience. The interface (lines 26-34) is non-trivial with 7 fields representing aggregated metrics. Other interfaces in the file (BatchProgress at line 9, AgentResult at line 18) also lack docs, but this specific issue is valid. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for a public API interface, and the recommendation to add TSDoc explaining the aggregated nature and field purposes is reasonable and actionable."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. BatchRunResult is an exported interface that aggregates results from batch execution (lines 26-34), but lacks TSDoc comments. Other interfaces in the same file (BatchProgress, AgentResult) also lack documentation, and this is a public API that would benefit from clear documentation explaining what the aggregated totals represent. The severity (medium) is appropriate for a missing public API documentation issue, and adding TSDoc would improve code maintainability and developer experience."
