# ISSUE-016: Obvious function description comment - 'Run a voter agent'

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Noise Comment
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/agents/voter.ts:6-8`

## Description

The comment 'Run a voter agent to validate candidate issues' simply describes what the function name 'runVoter' already makes clear. This is a syntax translation comment that adds no value. The comment should explain WHY voters are run sequentially (one issue at a time) or WHY three voters are used.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Run a voter agent to validate candidate issues
 */
export async function runVoter(options: VoterOptions): Promise<VoterResult> {
```

## Recommendation

Remove the comment or replace with meaningful context: 'Validates issues sequentially to avoid overwhelming the API and ensure each voter can read the file independently.'

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The comment on lines 6-8 is genuinely redundant. It merely restates what the function name 'runVoter' already conveys. The function name and signature are self-documenting. While the issue is minor (appropriately marked as low severity), removing noise comments does improve code quality. The recommendation to either remove it or explain WHY voters run sequentially is valid - the code shows sequential iteration (line 22) but doesn't explain the rationale, which could be valuable context for maintainers."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The comment on lines 6-8 genuinely adds no value beyond restating the function name 'runVoter'. The function's purpose is immediately clear from its name, parameters, and return type. The actual implementation shows it validates issues sequentially (line 21-22), which is contextually important but not explained. This is a valid noise comment that should be removed or enhanced with meaningful context."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The comment at lines 6-8 is indeed redundant. It merely restates what the function name 'runVoter' already conveys. The function has complex logic including sequential processing (line 22), error handling, and API calls, but the comment provides no insight into design decisions or non-obvious behavior. This is a genuine noise comment that should be removed or enhanced with meaningful context."
