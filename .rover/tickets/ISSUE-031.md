# ISSUE-031: Vague single-letter variable: r

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Vague Variable
**Detected by**: naming-renovator
**File**: `src/agents/batch-runner.ts:219-233`

## Description

The variable 'r' is used extensively in batch-runner.ts (lines 220-233, 236-246) and BatchApp.tsx (line 236) to represent agent results in reduce and filter operations. These operations span 5-10 lines each, making 'r' too vague for the scope. The variable represents complex AgentResult objects with nested properties, but the single letter gives no indication of this.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
const totalCandidateIssues = agentResults.reduce(
  (sum, r) => sum + r.scanResult.issues.length, 0
);
```

## Recommendation

Rename to 'agentResult' or 'result' to indicate it represents an agent's scan result

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 2/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "Genuine issue. The variable 'r' is used in 5 separate reduce operations (lines 219-233) accessing nested properties like r.scanResult.issues.length, r.arbitratorResult.approvedIssues.length, and r.voterResults.reduce(). In BatchApp.tsx it's used in filter/map chains (lines 236-246) spanning multiple lines. For such complex AgentResult objects with nested properties, 'r' is too cryptic. Renaming to 'result' or 'agentResult' would significantly improve readability without harming code quality."
- **Voter 2**: Rejected - "While 'r' is a single-letter variable, it's used in standard functional programming patterns (reduce, filter, map) where the context is immediately clear from the surrounding code. The operations are concise (2-3 lines each, not 5-10 as claimed), and 'r' follows common convention for reducer/iterator parameters. The type (AgentResult) is already clear from the agentResults array being operated on. Renaming to 'agentResult' would be more verbose without meaningfully improving readability in these short callback contexts. This is overly pedantic."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. In batch-runner.ts lines 219-233, 'r' represents AgentResult objects in multiple reduce operations spanning 14 lines total. In BatchApp.tsx lines 236-237, 'r' is used in filter and map operations. While single-letter parameters in short arrow functions are common, these operations involve accessing nested properties (r.scanResult.issues.length, r.arbitratorResult.approvedIssues.length) across multiple lines, making 'result' or 'agentResult' more readable. The severity is appropriate as medium - it's not critical but would improve code clarity."
