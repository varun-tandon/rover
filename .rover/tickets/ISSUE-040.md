# ISSUE-040: getAgentsByCategory missing documentation

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Missing Docs
**Detected by**: interface-documenter
**File**: `src/agents/batch-runner.ts:246-249`

## Description

The exported function `getAgentsByCategory` has no documentation. Users need to understand what categories exist and why agents are grouped this way.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
export function getAgentsByCategory(): Record<string, string[]>
```

## Recommendation

Add TSDoc explaining the purpose of categorization, @returns describing the structure of the returned object, and note that this is useful for UI display.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function `getAgentsByCategory` is an exported public API (lines 246-281) that has minimal documentation - only a brief one-line comment 'Get agent IDs grouped by category for display'. While this provides basic context, users would benefit from: 1) More detailed explanation of what the categories represent and how they're organized, 2) A @returns tag describing the Record structure, 3) Clarity on available categories and their purpose. The function returns a hardcoded categorization of agents which is part of the public API, so proper TSDoc would improve discoverability and usability. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate given this is a public API but not critical infrastructure."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function `getAgentsByCategory` at lines 246-281 is exported but only has a minimal TSDoc comment ('Get agent IDs grouped by category for display') that doesn't explain what categories exist, why agents are grouped this way, or describe the return structure. Given this is a public API that returns categorized agent IDs, users would benefit from documentation explaining the categorization scheme and the record structure. The severity of 'medium' is appropriate for missing public API documentation."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function `getAgentsByCategory()` at line 249 has a minimal TSDoc comment that only states 'Get agent IDs grouped by category for display' but lacks important details. Given this is an exported public API, users would benefit from documentation explaining: (1) what categories exist and their purposes, (2) the structure of the returned Record (category names as keys, arrays of agent IDs as values), and (3) the intended use case for UI display. The current documentation is insufficient for a public API, making this a valid medium-severity issue worth addressing."
