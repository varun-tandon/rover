# ISSUE-015: Obvious function description comment - 'Run the scanner agent'

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Noise Comment
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/agents/scanner.ts:7-9`

## Description

The comment 'Run the scanner agent to detect issues in the codebase' above the runScanner function simply restates what the function name already clearly indicates. The function name 'runScanner' already conveys that it runs a scanner. The comment should explain WHY this approach was taken or what architectural decisions were made, such as why it uses the query API or why deduplication happens first.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Run the scanner agent to detect issues in the codebase
 */
export async function runScanner(options: ScannerOptions): Promise<ScannerResult> {
```

## Recommendation

Remove this comment entirely, or replace it with context explaining the architectural decision: 'Runs scanner using Claude Agent SDK query API to enable autonomous tool use (Glob, Grep, Read) with permission bypass for readonly operations.'

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The comment 'Run the scanner agent to detect issues in the codebase' is indeed redundant given the function name 'runScanner'. The function implementation contains meaningful architectural details (query API usage, permission bypass, deduplication logic) that would be more valuable to document than restating the obvious. The recommended replacement provides actual context about WHY certain implementation decisions were made, which aligns with the scanner's guidelines of explaining 'why' not 'what'. The severity of 'low' is appropriate - this is a minor code quality issue that doesn't affect functionality but would improve maintainability."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The comment on lines 7-9 is a classic 'what' comment that provides no value beyond the function name. The function implementation (lines 10-138) reveals architectural decisions worth documenting: uses Claude SDK query API, performs deduplication against existing issues first, uses specific tool permissions, and has configurable max turns. The current comment is redundant noise, and the suggested replacement would provide actual value by explaining the 'why' behind the implementation approach."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The comment on lines 7-9 is genuinely redundant. The function name 'runScanner' already clearly indicates it runs a scanner. The comment adds no value beyond what the function name and signature convey. The recommendation to either remove it or replace it with architectural context (explaining why it uses the Claude Agent SDK query API, why deduplication happens first, or why permissionMode is 'bypassPermissions') would be a meaningful improvement. This is a legitimate noise comment that should be addressed."
