# ISSUE-028: Ticket number padding to 3 digits lacks explanation

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Missing Why
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/storage/tickets.ts:52-57`

## Description

The formatTicketNumber function pads ticket numbers to 3 digits (e.g., ISSUE-001, ISSUE-042), but there's no explanation of WHY 3 digits was chosen. Does this mean the system expects < 1000 issues? What happens after ISSUE-999?

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Format a ticket number with leading zeros
 */
function formatTicketNumber(num: number): string {
  return `ISSUE-${num.toString().padStart(3, '0')}`;
}
```

## Recommendation

Add a comment explaining the design decision: '// 3-digit padding (ISSUE-001 to ISSUE-999) for consistent sorting and readability. Chosen based on expected issue volume per project. System will continue with 4+ digits if needed (ISSUE-1000+).'

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The code uses padStart(3, '0') without explaining why 3 digits was chosen. The function is simple enough that 'what' is clear, but the 'why' behind the specific design decision (3 digits vs 2, 4, or dynamic padding) is not documented. The recommendation is reasonable and would add valuable context about the system's capacity expectations and behavior at scale. This aligns with the scanning guideline to explain 'why' not 'what'."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The function uses padStart(3, '0') with no explanation for why 3 digits was chosen. The code does handle numbers > 999 (padStart won't truncate), but this isn't obvious to developers. A comment explaining the design decision and behavior beyond 999 would improve maintainability and prevent confusion. The recommendation is reasonable and non-intrusive."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The formatTicketNumber function uses hardcoded 3-digit padding without explaining why. This is a valid 'missing why' issue because: (1) the choice of 3 digits has practical implications for system capacity, (2) it's not obvious what happens at ISSUE-1000+, and (3) the recommendation would genuinely improve code understanding without adding clutter. The severity 'low' is appropriate since the code works but lacks documentation of the design decision."
