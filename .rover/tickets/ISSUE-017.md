# ISSUE-017: Obvious function description comment - 'Group votes by issue ID'

**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Syntax Translation
**Detected by**: why-asker
**File**: `src/agents/arbitrator.ts:6-8`

## Description

The comment 'Group votes by issue ID' above the groupVotesByIssue function is pure syntax translation. The function name already clearly states what it does. There's no explanation of WHY this grouping is necessary or how it's used in the arbitration process.

## Problematic Code

```typescript
/**
 * Group votes by issue ID
 */
function groupVotesByIssue(votes: Vote[]): Map<string, Vote[]> {
```

## Recommendation

Remove this comment entirely. The function name is self-documenting.

## Voting Summary

**Result**: 3/3 votes to approve

- **Voter 1**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The comment 'Group votes by issue ID' on lines 6-8 is pure syntax translation that adds no value beyond what the function name 'groupVotesByIssue' already conveys. The function's purpose is self-evident from its name and signature. Notably, other similar helper functions in the file (like 'countApprovals' on line 24) have equally obvious comments, while the main 'runArbitrator' function (line 37) has a genuinely useful comment explaining WHY and HOW the arbitration process works. Removing this redundant comment would improve code quality by reducing noise without losing any meaningful information."
- **Voter 2**: Approved - "The comment is indeed pure syntax translation. The function name 'groupVotesByIssue' already clearly states what it does. The comment adds no information about WHY the grouping is needed (to facilitate vote counting per issue) or how it fits into the arbitration workflow. The function is simple enough that the name alone is self-documenting. Removing the comment would improve code quality."
- **Voter 3**: Approved - "The issue is genuine. The comment 'Group votes by issue ID' is pure syntax translation that adds no value - the function name 'groupVotesByIssue' already conveys this exact information. The comment doesn't explain why this grouping is necessary (to enable vote counting per issue for arbitration decisions) or provide any architectural context. This is a textbook example of a redundant comment that should be removed. The severity of 'low' is appropriate as it's a minor documentation issue."
